# Editr

Editr is a notion like editor that lets you create H1 text anywhere you want. All you have to do is type "/" to bring up blocks, **"1"** to select **Heading 1**, then **"Enter"** to create a H1 element block. After that, have fun by typing in your Heading. when you're done just press **"Enter"** again to go to a new block. You can also use **"Enter"** to create an empty block anywhere on the page. Cool, right?
